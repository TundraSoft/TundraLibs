# DAM - Database Abstraction & Management

This library is the result of months of damn, whay wont this db client do that. Written on a weekend
over a bottle of rum, there be bugs you never dreamed of.

Known issues:

- Expressions with column reference in insert will throw error (expected behaviour)
- SQLite to be tested
- MongoDB add support for joins and expressions
- Handle SCHEMA for sqlite and figure work around for MongoDB join
